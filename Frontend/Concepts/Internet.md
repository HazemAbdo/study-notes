* The internet is a network of networks.

* Some basic concepts and terminology:
	* **Internet Protocol (IP)** A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, used to route data to the correct destination.
	* **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** which ensures that packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order.
	* **Domain Name System (DNS)** is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses.
	*  **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website).
	*  **Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)** are used to provide secure communication over the internet.

* TCP/IP provides a reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on different devices.
	*  **Ports** are used to identify the application or service running on a device
	*  A **socket** is a combination of an IP address and a port number.
	* A **connection** is established between two sockets.

* SSL/TLS is a protocol used to encrypt data being transmitted over the internet.
	* **Certificates:** SSL/TLS certificates are used to establish trust between the client and server.
	* **Handshake:** During it the client and server exchange information to negotiate the encryption algorithm and other parameters for the secure connection.
 
* To connect our network to the telephone infrastructure, we need a special piece of equipment called a **_modem_**. This _modem_ turns the information from our network into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure and vice versa.

* An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a company that manages some special _routers_ that are all linked together and can also access other ISPs' routers.

* The _Internet_ is an **infrastructure**, whereas the **_Web_ is a service built on top of the infrastructure**. It is worth noting there are several other services built on top of the Internet, such as email and [IRC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IRC).
